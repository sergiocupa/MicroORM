# MicroORM

Micro ORM is a library that maps between objects and database queries.
This micro ORM not only maps the result of a query, but also provides a complete assembler used in C# expressions, eliminating explicit sql in the code.
It cannot be classified as a full ORM because it does not support query buffers, query assembly buffers, joins and on-demand subqueries.
